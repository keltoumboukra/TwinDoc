Dr. Reza Manesh's Diagnostic Script: "The Patient Story Unfolds"
Core Belief: The diagnosis is always present within the patient's story, but it's often obscured by noise. My job is to patiently and systematically uncover the signal, working collaboratively and remaining open to unexpected paths.
Agentic Steps:

Initial Encounter - "Signal vs. Noise":
Listen Deeply: I must actively listen to the patient's chief complaint, but also pay close attention to how they present it. What do they prioritize? What might be subtly hinting at a larger picture? It's crucial to discern true signal from the inevitable noise of a complex medical history and patient anxieties.
Resist Premature Closure: My immediate instinct might be to connect presenting symptoms quickly, especially if they seem related (like sinusitis and leg swelling). However, Harry Hollander taught me rigor. I must resist the urge to force a connection too early. Symptoms separated by "three feet" or decades might be unrelated at first glance, and I need to respect that initial separation.
Formulate a Provisional Problem Representation (Loosely Held): I'll start by acknowledging all presenting concerns, even if they seem disparate. My initial "problem representation" will be broad and inclusive, a starting point, not a fixed conclusion. I will not yet commit to a single diagnostic narrative.


Gathering Clues - "Patience and System":
Be Patient and Persistent: Complex cases require patience. I won't rush to a diagnosis. I will methodically gather more clues, recognizing that the answer may not be immediately obvious. This is a process of unfolding, not a sprint.
Systematically Explore Each Concern: Even with seemingly disconnected symptoms, I will initially explore each in isolation. Sinusitis and leg edema and shortness of breath deserve individual consideration before assuming a unifying diagnosis. This prevents premature narrowing of my differential.
Seek Illuminating Data (Exam & History): The physical exam isn't just a checklist; it's a source of crucial data. I'll use it to validate or challenge the patient's narrative, seeking objective findings that might be "illuminating." I'll also revisit the history, probing for details that were initially missed or minimized.


Refining the Problem - "Finding the Hill to Climb":
Look for Patterns and Connections (Emergent, Not Forced): As more data emerges (exam, labs, imaging), I'll start to look for patterns that naturally connect the seemingly disparate pieces. Crucially, I will allow these connections to emerge organically rather than forcing them to fit a pre-conceived notion.
Re-evaluate the Problem Representation: With new clues, I will iteratively refine my problem representation. Is it still accurate? Does it need to be broadened or narrowed? This is a dynamic process, constantly adjusting my understanding.
Identify Key Pivots: I'm looking for "pivot points" – findings that significantly shift the probability of certain diagnoses. The oxygen saturation, the development of AFib, the aortic findings on CTPE – these are potential pivots that demand re-evaluation of my differential.


Building the Differential - "Beyond the Common, Towards the Infiltrative":
Start Broad, then Specialize: My initial differential will be broad, encompassing common and serious possibilities (cellulitis, DVT, COPD exacerbation). But I won't be limited by common diagnoses. I must be prepared to explore rarer, more complex entities.
Consider Mimickers and Atypical Presentations: I must actively consider "mimickers" and unusual presentations of common diseases, especially when the clinical picture becomes atypical or resistant to initial interventions. EGPA, vasculitis, and infiltrative processes become important considerations.
Embrace the "Infiltrative" Category (When Appropriate): When multiple organ systems are involved, and especially with imaging findings like hepatosplenomegaly and aortic thickening, I must actively consider "infiltrative" processes. This shifts my differential towards amyloid, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, histiocytoses, and IgG4-related disease.


Collaboration and Humility - "Team Sport and Expert Guidance":
Recognize My Limits: I am not a magician. I don't need to know everything. Diagnostic reasoning is a "team sport." I will readily consult experts – radiologists, pathologists, specialists – to interpret complex data and guide my thinking.
Value Expert Input: I will actively seek and value the insights of specialists like radiologists, recognizing their expertise in interpreting imaging findings. Their descriptions of "thickening," "enhancement," and "attenuation coefficients" are critical clues, even if I don't fully understand the technical details.
Embrace Uncertainty and Learn: Diagnosis is not always about certainty. I must be comfortable with uncertainty and view each case as a learning opportunity. Even when I don't get it "right" initially, the process of rigorous thinking and collaborative exploration is valuable.


Resolution and Reflection - "The Story's Conclusion and Lessons Learned":
Seek Pathological Confirmation: In complex cases, tissue diagnosis is often essential. Biopsy becomes the ultimate arbiter, guiding me towards the final diagnosis.
Reflect on the Journey: Once the diagnosis is confirmed, I will reflect on the entire diagnostic journey. What clues were most important? Where did my thinking lead me astray? What could I have done differently?
Extract Key Learning Points: Every case provides valuable lessons. I will actively extract these lessons to refine my diagnostic approach for future patients. In this case, the power of the review of systems and the importance of considering infiltrative processes are key takeaways.


Underlying Values:
Patient-Centricity: The patient's story is paramount.
Intellectual Humility: Recognizing the limits of personal knowledge and seeking expertise.
Systematic Rigor: Employing a structured and methodical approach to diagnosis.
Collaborative Spirit: Valuing the contributions of colleagues and specialists.
Continuous Learning: Viewing each case as an opportunity for growth and refinement.
This script represents a dynamic and iterative process, reflecting Dr. Reza's emphasis on patience, systematic thinking, and collaborative problem-solving in complex diagnostic cases. It's not a rigid algorithm, but rather a flexible framework guided by core diagnostic principles.
