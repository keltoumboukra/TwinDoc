[Reza] I just wanna share on... - Make sure that's on, is it? Yep, and hold it closer.
Yeah, it's an honor to be here every single time, but especially today. And I think that I'm gonna kick off this case
by sharing our gratitude to everyone, especially for the honor for being here on Harry Hollander Day,
which is such a treat. I distinctly remember as a fourth year medical student on a wave rotation sitting across from Harry nervously so,
and getting to know him over the course of the years has been an honor for both of us. And so thank you for having us and I'm very excited to give it a try today.
Yes, I'm gonna leave the medicine for Rabih to discuss.
Perfect. - Just wanted to make two quick comments. One, I am not supposed to be here today.
The only reason I'm here is that Rabih knew how important Harry was to me, is to me,
and decided to share this stage. So thank you for that. And then the second thing is I was having dinner with Asa Clemenzi last night at Zozzy's
and he said, "Don't you get nervous about this?" I said, "No, 'cause Harry taught me that this can be one
of two diagnoses, either infectious or non-infectious." I'm feeling very confident.
Yes, I am intrigued by that. And I think this is gonna be a challenging case 'cause I'm not really sure what's signal and what's noise
'cause there's a myriad of concerns that the patient has. And so the question is where do we focus our attention?
What I've learned is to just be patient. Like, we're not at a, we're not at a pivot point yet. There isn't anything that's strong enough for me
to start investing significant cognitive energy. However, I think the exam is gonna be illuminating.
And I think with the prior sinus surgeries, it makes me wonder what was the pathology
that led to those prior surgeries 'cause that may be linked to what's happening
as the patient presents today. But really the big thing for me is I don't really have a problem representation yet.
There's too much going on for me to settle on one specific concern to tackle.
And that is what you're trying to do. You're trying to basically come up with the one liner that you're trying to solve?
Precisely because if you don't formulate the correct problem representation, you'll 100% end up at the wrong diagnosis.
And so when you get a case like this, you just have to be patient and you have to use more clues to try to figure out
what hill you plan to climb. - Okay. Anything to add, Rabih? - Yeah, I completely agree with Reza.
I think we have to be very, very cautious 'cause getting the problem right is so fundamental
to not going down completely the wrong pathway. If you wouldn't mind going back to one slide, like, I was intrigued.
I pay a lot of attention to how our patients decide
what their chief concern is and what they decide to tell us when we prompt them. And I find it very intriguing that the sinusitis
and the leg rise above the level of shortness of breath.
And I say that because I think you can make a lot of inferences as to why somebody would choose to emphasize their sinus in their leg
over what could be their heart or their lungs. And I think that that might mean that the three foot rule
that we talked about no longer applies. And that now if you look at this very strictly, you're saying there's something in the head,
there's something in the leg. And the only thing that we're missing really is the abdomen And the impetus to actually reframe this not
as too discreet entities of the sinus and the leg, but to say based on the thoracic symptoms,
but most importantly based on the low grade fever, chills, and fatigue, this doesn't seem
to be a compartmentalized disease separating, sparing the viscera.
This seems to be a low-grade systemic disease process.
And I think that it's so easy to disregard the underlying tempo
of the background information because in reality most of this stuff,
because the patient chose to say it on review of systems, in real life, probably turns out to be more noise than it does signal.
But what do I really wanna do on exam? I wanna make sure that I don't get trapped into the vortex
of just paying attention to correlates of what the patient led with. Say, "Hey, is there actually a signature in the chest
and is there a signature systemically?" So the one vital sign that I probably won't get unless I ask for it is a weight
is something I'm really, really intrigued by. Because if this stuff is signal, it probably will be accompanied by weight loss.
And if it's not accompanied by weight loss, this probably is distracter. - So that's an interesting cognitive leap you just made.
So sinus and leg, I guess maybe there's some three foot rule,
too far apart to be connected. - I made it up. - And add in shortness of breath.
And no longer are you thinking about discrete things, but now you're packaging in them. Is that because shortness
of breath has a certain kind of salience? It sort of rises in level of importance and if you had just given that as the chief complaint,
it would've dominated it or it's now three things and that seems too weird for them to be three independent things?
Yeah, I think that the underlying assumption here is that there are no benign causes of shortness of breath
or spontaneously resolving ones. There are many spontaneously resolving conditions that involve the sinuses and the legs.
And so I think that a specific explanation for the shortness of breath is needed. And by the way, I retract that.
I did not come up with the three foot rule. - Yeah. - Colleague and mentor Mike Nejad did. And I give him full credit for that or not if it doesn't...
Yeah, it may not work. In which case you now know who to blame. - Okay, good. But helpful to see how you're thinking
about it really is you add that in and now it feels like there's something involving multiple parts of the body.
It's hard to now just say it's two discrete things. - And something low grade and sneaky. And I think the tricky part about this stuff
is it's not in your face shortness of breath and hectic fevers. It's something that's been trickling on for a little while.
Great. Okay, let's hear a little more.
Some meds. Vastatin, timolol, Tylenol, and ibuprofen.
Some ophthalmic stuff and a bunch of supplements. Make anything out of any of that?
The unmute button. Nada. All right. - We'll move on.
Past history: born in Germany, raised in Iowa, pretty common pathway.
Professor and veteran also, we got a lot of interesting combinations here. Lives alone in San Francisco,
goes to Europe a bunch of times a year. Family history: father and mother died of probably their cardiovascular disease
at reasonable ages. Health-related behavior. A former smoker, but quit a long time ago.
Alcohol, six drinks per week, and denies other substance use.
Physical exam. Afebrile, little bit desaturated, 94% on two liters.
Little systolic hypertension, otherwise fine. We don't get a weight.
And Karena's put the case together, is nice enough to put the red stuff in to help you.
Constitutional, okay. Minimal tenderness to palpation over the sinuses with some clear drainage.
Cardiac exam, normal. Pulmonary exam shows some wheezing.
Abdomen appears to be benign. Extremities, the left lower extremity edema
with well-demarcated borders, pitting edema to the thigh, tender to palpation, and pulses are okay.
Sensation seems okay. Right leg trace pitting edema to the calf. Neuro seems fine.
And skin, no rashes or lesions. Comments? - Yeah, totally.
I think the oxygen saturation surprised me and that's something that the final diagnosis must explain.
Interestingly enough, a lot of patients who are labeled as having COPD or asthma never actually have a pulmonary function test.
And I think in a case like this where we're worried about multiple organs being involved,
it's really important to look at the prior data to see if this diagnosis of COPD was in fact confirmed or not.
Because if it's a new diagnosis later in life, maybe we question that and we think of a mimicker like EGPA.
I think with regard to the sinus tenderness... - Oh, the mimicker was what? - EGPA. - What is that?
Oh, EGPA is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. - Of course. - Oh, sorry.
I was testing you. - Oh, okay. - What did that used to be called?
I put away what it used to be called. - Okay. All right. I think Wegner's, if I'm not...
It was the old Wegner's. - Or Churg-Strauss. - Churg-Strauss Thanks. - Thank you. (Bob laughing)
And then you have the sinus tenderness. And I think that's intriguing.
He's had issues with his sinuses in the past and it would be really interesting to see if you can link sinus, lung,
and what's happening in the lower extremities. I think the main key here, Bob, is that not all wheezing is due to COPD or asthma.
There are other causes and, like, confirming those diagnoses by looking at prior data is gonna be important.
And something with the lower extremities that was really interesting is that oftentimes when someone presents
with a unilateral problem, we assume it's only unilateral. But remember sometimes a bilateral process starts unilateral
or an asymmetrical process dominates your eye and your mind where you don't pay attention
to the other extremity. So here, the leg being edematous makes me think anatomically
is there something happening at the level of the skin and soft tissue, is something happening at the level of the muscle,
the fascia, the bone? And then in that review system that you presented, there was calf numbness.
Now that's a peculiar finding that I would investigate further. And I don't know if that's because of the edema compressing the superficial nerves.
And then finally going to that right lower extremity. It just makes me wonder whether this is initially unilateral
where we automatically jump to stuff like DVT, cellulitis, Charcot,
but rather given time, does it become bilateral? And really what we should be exploring
is cause of bilateral lower extremity edema. - So let me show you a picture.
Any comments on that? - Yeah. Yeah, oh, so I'm impressed
and surprised by the degree of erythema. I think it really stands out in the visual. I see that the foot really has,
oh, you mentioned that the patient has chronic venous stasis. You see given the medial predominance, especially on the right and left.
So what is it that you're cuing on to tell you that you think it is venous stasis? - The medial predominance on the right
and the left of the erythema. - Of hyperpigmentation or erythema? - Yeah, of erythema, hyperpigmentation,
and of course, the sock sign, which I think I see only on the right side suggesting that this has been going on for some time.
So a sock sign, meaning where at the margin of his sock you're more likely to get hyperpigmentation?
Exactly. And I think more so on the right than the left, you appreciate the superficial dilated varicose veins
which are more prominent on the foot, a little bit unusual in their location, I usually expect them to be more on the lower aspect of the tibia.
But I think, you know, it's hard often for non-dermatologists to vocalize the,
like, I look at this leg and I can tell you more confidence internally than I can vocalize that there's chronicity to this problem.
But the left is, gosh, I mean I think I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out
if I can be confident distinguishing a DVT from cellulitis and I think I would have a really tough time. 'Cause in general, the more swollen a leg is,
the more likely it is to be venous hypertension, acute or chronic. The more erythematous and painful it is,
the more likely it is to be infected. And I think this patient seems to have prominent features of both. So in real life, would probably evaluate for both.
I think it would be really, really telling to see what happens to that left leg with 30 minutes
or an hour of elevation 'cause I think if I were seeing this case in real life, Bob, I would not have guessed
that they end up as a CPS case. And the reason I say that is patient has a history of asthma, patient has a history of venous stasis,
here they are with sinus issues, thoracic concerns, and potentially complications of venous stasis.
So I'm really, really... - Really, we could screw up pretty badly by making that a CPS case.
You know, I think I would be stumped if this turns out to be cellulitis in a little bit of a bad aspect because my mind is not going there
at all knowing the bias of this. But I think it just goes to show how authentically the conclusions that will come
to at the end of the hour will be very interesting. And I'm excited to see what the twist will be.
I don't see a twist yet, but in retrospect, I'll wanna know what the weight is 'cause, again, I think that that review of systems is key.
Is that signal or is it noise? And it would be really, really telling to see, despite the edema, despite the venous stasis,
has the weight gone down? And I'd be really, I know I probably don't have that data now and I probably wouldn't get it
in real life honestly because you are dealing with acuity. But I think... - Is it bothering you that if your main differential cellulitis versus DVT,
is it bothering you to not have a fever with that much cellulitis? - It's a really, really good question. You definitely see fever with cellulitis,
but I would say that's the exception rather than the rule. I say that with a little bit of humility because I don't know how good I am at diagnosing cellulitis.
It's a very tricky diagnosis to make. And if you look at the dermatology literature, we get it wrong plenty of times.
And I would say the number of times I've diagnosed a febrile surface infection
of the foot is not many. - Okay. Anything to add? - Nada.
And one of the things you were cuing on on the exam was hypoxemia.
Does that create an illness script here? Oh, he's got a DVT and he is got a PE, boom, I'm done.
No, not at all. It just makes me intrigued to look at the lungs and just knowing that our physical exam is limited,
a positive finding is positive and it should alter the process. Like, if I heard crackles, like, is there water or pus in that lungs?
But a negative finding does not exclude the possibility of parenchymal pathology.
So I'm very curious am I gonna label this as image negative hypoxemia or is a chest x-ray gonna show something
that explains the hypoxia. - Okay, so you've already kind of gone through this.
Let's go. Yeah, go ahead, Harry. - [Harry] Does it sound good?
I'm just wondering if you're thinking about cellulitis mimickers at this point.
You've mentioned a couple of common ones. Should we be thinking about less common things
in the context of somebody who, as you have already pointed out, sounds as though he may have
a systemic inflammatory illness?
Would it be crossing my mind in real life? I don't think so, honestly.
And that probably is reality just dumbed down, damped down by sheer base rate
of unusual presentations presenting this way. It would be very different if you were febrile. I think it would be pretty different
if he didn't have the context of the venous stasis and the COPD to have inlets to unusual presentations of those diseases.
So if I'm being authentic about what I'd be doing in real life, I don't think I would be right now.
I clearly should be based on where we're going. - Well, based on the fact that you're at...
Yeah. - Under rounds, right? - And honestly, I'm really excited to see, in retrospect,
if there was a clue, and I'm excited to learn from you, in retrospect, if there was a clue that we could latch onto now.
You know, I think you can say, "Oh, this is a", I'm not gonna say that word again 'cause I'm thinking in the back of my mind.
But there is sinusitis, there's asthma that triggers a whole chain of things
that I think because we're being slow and reflective here, we're prone to thinking about.
I'll say it again. The only thing that would change my mind in the moment is if I saw weight loss. I think that would really make me worried.
Okay, pretty skinny right leg. - Yeah. Agreed, agreed, agreed.
And then the observation on the toes too. Yeah, there are things there, but I don't know if I would with the sort
of data we have now. - Okay, let's go on. We have a little anemia, a little low iron,
a little A1C, and a little TSH. Electrolytes seem fine.
Maybe a tiny elevation in creatinine from baseline, glucose 153, LFT's fine, albumin 3.1.
Any of that interesting or surprising? - Not surprising but interesting, yes. In that the low albumin, the anemia,
the high ferritin points to this underlying inflammatory process,
the transference that being low tells you there's a mixed iron deficiency and anemia, chronic inflammation,
and the creatinine, we have to be very cautious here 'cause we're saying this patient is cachectic, has lost muscle mass.
Creatinine comes from the muscle. A better test of renal function is cystatin C in this context who Shlipak really popularized.
And I would say I would really be interested in a urinalysis 'cause I wanna know as we're exploring the possibility
of a multi-systemic disease, whether the kidneys are affected as well.
Both in part due to the creatine elevation and likely weight loss. But I'm just very curious to see if there's any proteinuria
that may explain some kind of underlying small vessel pathology.
Okay. Patient went to the clinical decision unit
for observation. While awaiting studies to return, he developed AFib with RVR, given fluids, metoprolol.
Chest x-ray, cardiac silhouette, partly obscured, right hemidiaphragm elevated, mild bibasilar atelectasis,
no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. DVT ultrasound is negative for a DVT
up to the common femoral vein and they see subcutaneous edema in the left lower extremity.
All right, any comments on any of this right now? - Yeah, I'd emphasize that that negative DVT ultrasound,
the performance characteristics of that are phenomenal. So I think that in the world of common things being common, you would probably say, "Okay,
you know, I'm gonna treat this patient empirically for cellulitis and watch what happens to that leg." I'd say the AFib here is very, very telling,
'cause again, you can park that right next to the COPD, but the development of it in this context,
especially noting how prominent the edema was on that left lower leg makes you,
that's why I would be a little bit systematic and say, "Okay, what causes the trigger of atrial fibrillation with RVR?"
And I think a three-pronged simple way of thinking about that is the patient has an increased sympathetic tone for whatever reason.
And here with the possibility of an infection, that's a very plausible explanation. The others is adjacent diseases.
You all become accustomed to anything in the cardiothoracic area being an explanation for triggering AFib being as common as COPD
as postoperative CT surgery. But that hypothesis, that sort of adjacent structural disease is
what I'm really thinking about because we've not lost track of the fact that this patient had longstanding
and a key word here, longstanding non-exertional shortness of breath.
I hear that and I think that this case, the development of atrial fibrillation and the pickup of hypoxemia pushes
that front and center in my mind. I say, "What could cause somebody to feel short of breath
that would not be affected by their exertion?" Is it the heart, unusual. Is it the lungs, unusual.
Is it the blood, unusual. Or is it the common denominator, i.e., the mediastinum?
You know, to skip over a deep dive reflection. But if you are dealing with a systemic disease that lands in the chest, it's probably landing in the chest
because of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or mediastinal vascular issues
like the pulmonary RV or the aorta. So even with a completely normal D-dimer in this instance,
as you showed us on the next slide, I'd be really interested in actually looking at the mediastinum in this person in large part
because there seems to be no pulmonary parenchymal or overt cardiac, i.e., heart failure, other arrhythmia.
So long story short, I'm really glad that they got the CTPE both for the PE aspect.
But also to really visualize the mediastinum. - So you would not just say AFib 'cause sick person and maybe inflammatory state,
but you're wondering is something tweaking the heart that's causing it and there are a whole bunch of structures nearby
and it sort of goes with the shortness of breath, something's going on but we haven't found out what it is just yet. - Put it better than I just did.
All right, good. CTPE. Oh, that's not projecting at all.
I will tell you that is the aorta that is being outlined there. And we have a reading on it.
Sorry it didn't project. Exam degraded by respiratory motion artifact such that segmental and smaller emboli could be missed
but no large PE seen. Soft tissue attenuation around the thoracic aorta
and proximal arch vessels, which could represent intramural hematoma or vasculitis.
So you are wondering is there's something going on in the vessels or the mediastinum appears to be true, right?
So what do you think? - Yes, I'm reminded of Dr. Ken Sacks and a pearl he shared when I was a resident here.
He said it's easy to diagnose a vasculopathy but difficult to diagnose a vasculitis.
And here we're faced with that on the CAT scan where it seems like we have vessel pathology
and the question becomes is that due to atherosclerosis and then a subsequent hematoma in someone who has a history
of cardiovascular disease or is the vessel actually inflamed because of an underlying either infectious
or non-infectious vasculitis? And I think back to Mike Nejad or Rabih's three foot rule,
all of a sudden, we're now making the connection between the sinus, the legs, and potentially the mediastinum.
I would view this as signal as opposed to noise. And I would be curious whether this is representative
of either a large vessel vasculitis that's autoimmune in nature or infectious in nature.
And the radiologists are really good to see how that gadolinium or iodinated contrast enhances the aortic wall.
And based on its enhancement, if it's full thickness, et cetera, they can prioritize amongst inflammatory processes.
So it could be that this is a hematoma from athero spread. I think it would be a mistake to dismiss this finding.
I think it just invokes the possibility of both. - Even though the finding is almost an incidental finding. I guess. Rabih, you sort of convinced me,
maybe it's not incidental 'cause you were interested in the vessels as opposed to I would've just been getting a PE study,
a negative PE and next case. So to you it was not an incidental finding. It was something you were very interested in
as you were trying to piece the whole thing together. - As I said, we hang out once a week and do this together.
And I think in many of our conversations, we've talked about how, of course, what we say out loud is probably not true.
That the answer is literally in the history. But I think what we have passed on
through generations is that a powerful clue to the answer in the history is, and yes, I think
if the patient did not have low-grade fevers and he did not have non-exertional shortness of breath,
this would probably be an incidental finding. But if you go back and you gain confidence that the patient is having periodic fevers at home,
chills, and actually has non-exertional shortness of breath, I think this is a very good explanation for that finding.
Now the question I think is you probably would believe that this is signal, the question is, it is quite a leap of faith to go to call this a vasculitis
because the radiographic imprint of fat stranding may be a distracter.
It also is a little bit of leap of faith 'cause when we say vasculitis, we, unfortunately, assume it's autoimmune in nature
when there are some infections and malignancies to also consider affecting the aorta. So I think resisting the,
oh, this is GCA right away is important and there's two steps to that. How confident are we that it's inflammatory?
And I'd say we'd be a little bit more confident on the patient's symptoms. And then to take a brief pause
and say, "Okay, I've said inflammatory. I know inflammatory plus vascular
often means vasculitis, but it's often enough the patient has a cat
and they have Bartonella or the patient has an infiltrative malignancy and their anemia becomes more significant."
Those would be my two cautions. - I'm gonna move on in a sec, but you're not only trying to piece together this finding,
but you're still interested in the sinuses and still interested in the leg. Does that sway you that you have to figure out something
that could be doing the aorta but also involving those other organs that tilt you toward an itis
versus an infection versus something else? - No, honestly it doesn't necessarily.
But if I'm in that vasculitis bucket that's autoimmune, all of a sudden, I start thinking about a variable vessel vasculitis,
something that can involve all vessels as opposed to just specific large vessel,
medium vessel, or small vessel 'cause we said it was a sinus, we have stuff going on in the lower extremities and then we have this big aorta that's involved.
Okay. All right, I'm gonna move along a little bit. Vascular surgeries consulted. Given the concern for hematoma,
they recommend an eight hour clearance of the contrast and to repeat the study. And I think you've kind of gone through this.
Let's get some additional data. Vascular surgery recommended lowering the blood pressure
in case this was, I guess, in case it's bleeding. Given the erythema, started on empiric antibiotics
for possible cellulitis. Repeat CT was done with contrast. Let's see if this shows up.
Not particularly well. The reading is mural thickening of the thoracic aorta
and proximal arch vessels unchanged an extent and thickness from the recent CT
and demonstrates attenuation coefficient in the high 50s. In the appropriate clinical setting such
as acute chest pain, this raises suspicion for a type A intramural hematoma,
particularly given another finding when enlarging left pleural effusion.
All right. Where are you now based on that study? - Bob, can we go just two slides before if that's okay?
And I'll leave this for Rabih. Well, one more slide before, yeah, leave that up. - Rabih's an expert on the coefficient numbers.
Looking forward to hearing him go through that. - I just wanted to comment on the text that was on this slide
or the previous slide, Bob. Now I made you do all that, I feel like I have to say something really epic.
Yeah, it's gonna be good. (everyone laughing) - I do have something epic to share. The labetalol.
It's really important to realize, and I made this mistake as a third year resident at the county hospital
where someone was having an acute aortic syndrome and I thought I just had to lower the blood pressure and I gave hydralazine.
What I learned from Lawrence Tyranny is that, no, you want to decrease the sheer stress into the aorta.
If you just give hydralazine, if you think about the physics formula of DP over DT, don't think about it. Don't Wikipedia it.
You need to decrease both the heart rate and what's happening. And so labetalol is the right choice
when you're worried about acute aortic syndromes 'cause it does decrease the sheer stress that's occurring.
Okay, great. You wanna comment on the 50 coefficient or we'll leave that one for another.
This one of my favorite things I get to say. I have absolutely no clue what that means. - Oh, okay, good. - [Rabih] I look forward to that moment.
Yeah, I lean heavily, this is a team sport and I would be in getting informed
by our friendly radiologist and other experts too. - Sounds good. All right, we have a bunch of additional data coming.
Given the normal DVT ultrasound, vascular recommended venous phase imaging to evaluate for I guess a higher up thrombosis.
On repeat review of systems, the patient denied chest or back pain. Also denied a history of hypertension.
You have some labs here with sed rate and CRP in red.
Urine protein a little elevated, otherwise, UA is normal. You see the protein creatinine ratio.
CK is normal. ANA low. Complements fine. Smear you see there with anisocytosis.
And troponin 0.02. Comments? - Yeah, I think that we're getting more and more weight of...
Hold it a little closer. Yeah. - Yeah, I think we're getting more and more weight that this is, in fact, an inflammatory syndrome.
And I say that not because of the ESR 'cause aids adjusted, that's probably not too too high with the CRP and I think you could park
that CRP onto the leg and say, "Hey, this is a DVT ultrasound negative left lower extremity cellulitis."
But I think that the aortic findings cannot be ignored. And I think that given the,
I mean, I just go on radiology buzzwords. I think experts interpret these images and I'm not one of them,
but thickening to me is a concept that implies chronicity.
And I think that the syndrome of what,
you know, going back again, the patient said this has been going on for, there's something brewing beyond the sinus and the leg and the CRP I think adds a little bit of weight of evidence.
I think it's plausible to park it next to the leg, but I think it's too morbid to dismiss the idea
that the inflammation actually is originating in the chest and the aorta. So I would ask myself,
I don't know that this is aortitis, but I know that that word sounds really scary
and I should probably start to either think about it myself or get very, very close to getting some experts involved.
Okay. You're agreeing? All right. - Always. - Thank you. - Always.
And by the way, I should point out the t-shirts. So these are Hollander... - Yes. - T-shirts that they're both wearing,
bespoke Hollander t-shirts. You cannot get this at Target. Okay, they get a CT abdomen
and pelvis I guess looking for other areas that might be involved or infiltrated.
And what they see is diffuse periarterial soft tissue thickening or less likely mural thickening
involving several arteries in the belly and pelvis, no lymphadenopathy.
A thin, irregular rind of enhancing soft tissue surrounds both kidneys with infiltration into the renal sinus
along the proximal periureteral space causing mild left pelviectasis,
which I looked up and actually is a thing, without frank hydronephrosis. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are seen.
Interesting 'cause the LFTs were normal. - Yes, and this also highlights
that the exam is just not perfect at detecting these abnormalities. A simple way to hepatomegaly is just to think is the liver inflamed?
Is it congested or is it infiltrated? I think once you have enlarged liver, enlarged spleen,
and stuff going on in the aorta and the sinus, that infiltrative category in my mind gets prioritized.
And now I think we really gotta view the aortic pathology
as beyond just atherosclerosis, as beyond atherosclerosis. And really I would lean into vasculitis at this point.
And in my mind, in addition to infections like staph, streps, syphilis, salmonella,
and atypical stuff, I would be thinking about that autoimmune category. And I know with the kidneys
and the finding around it, there is a pathognomonic finding
for a rare diagnosis Erdheim-Chester disease, which is hairy kidney. So I might talk... - Hairy kidney?
Not Harry Hollander but hairy. - Harry, we named these rounds for him but I don't think the kidneys been...
No, no, the kidneys are not part of it. Yeah, so like that category beyond, like, large vessel,
which is giant cell, takayasus, the variable vessel is relapsing polyangiitis, but we don't really have any cartilage stuff going on.
Then there's Behcet's but there's no ulcers. There's Cogan's, which I don't know much about
so I'll defer to Rabih, but I know that sinus and more upper here. And then you have Erdheim-Chester disease.
Dr. Da Lio and I, we published my first case, not his first case, by that time, it was 100 for him.
Of a coat with the clue and the coat was the aorta and it just entirely was enhanced,
which was due to infiltrative, it's a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
But I'm just curious to Rabih, like, what do you think? Are you in that infiltrative category or... - Yeah, I'm right there next to you.
And I think that it's just, isn't it humbling what can be hidden in the abdomen and pelvis?
I mean, we examined this person, listened to their chest, felt their belly, and there was nothing there. It goes back to listening very intently
to what your patient was saying. And I think I'm right there with you. I'm running my differential diagnosis for a vasculitis.
And as a brief primer, we tend to divide vasculitities as proffered, I said, into large vessel, medium vessel,
small vessel and then recognize a category of diseases where the patient can have vasculitis across multiple spectrum.
And that's called a variable vessel vasculitis. If you want to associate buzzwords with each of these conditions, you'll see a small vessel vasculitis
affects the skin in the form of purpura and the kidney in the form of glomerulonephritis. Both of those are absent here.
Medium vessel vasculitis are very, very cryptic and they essentially affect, most of the time, the intraabdominal organs
with a polyarteritis nodosa being the lead example, though that can have skin manifestation.
And then in kids, really, Kawasaki's disease in the heart. Large vessel vasculitities are the ones
that will be entertaining here, involvement of the aorta. And I would just emphasize that as you start
to think about the large vessel vasculitities, you'll be triggered to think reflexively of, based on age, giant cell arteritis and an older adult
and Takayasu's arteritis in the younger person. Those are gonna be the the things
that you think about the most. However, variable vessel vasculitities
by definition affect all vessels and you're gonna be running that list as well. And then you're gonna be a little bit cautious
and remember that large vessels, including the aorta, have small vessels that feed them, the vasa vasorum.
So there are rare presentations of small vessel vasculitities affecting the aorta.
And so we had a case on our platform of somebody who had glomerulonephritis and aortitis and they had...
I would say what's the most powerful filter to apply that. I would say this isn't... - Move the mic a little closer.
Oh, this isn't just a vasculitis, this seems to be a vasculitis
with a prominent extravascular imprint. And so in some sense, if you close your eyes
and visualize what's happening, there is a disease infiltrating the liver and the spleen
and infiltrating the blood vessels. And radiologists can actually study that
and tell you based on the pattern of inflammation, if it's circumferential around the outside of the aorta
or partially around the outside of the aorta. So this is why I'm right there with Prof Rez and I would be, of course,
prioritizing based on base rate GCA in this patient. But the infiltrative pattern is very, very open.
What is GCA? - Giant cell arteries. - And you'd be prioritizing just because it's a more common disease
in some of the less common disease that that Reza mentioned. - You say older adult with aortitis,
you have to lead with GCA. It's so common. Unusual, less common version
of that's probably still more common than anything else. But the weight of the infiltrative pattern is so strong here
that you would probably say okay now let me go to that variable vessel category and pursue that.
Not in lieu of but alongside. And that's when I go back to the leg
because I agree with Prof Rez. The radiographic imprint here is very telling at Erdheim-Chester disease
and Erdheim-Chester disease will, universally, have bilateral bony involvement in both.
So now I'm wondering, "Hey, was I wrong about the inflammation being in the skin? Was it actually in the bones?"
And importantly, going back to the sinus, sinusitis in a vasculitis world triggers the notion
of the ANCA-associated vasculitities, which we talked about how they could loop back in and cause aortitis to the vasa vasorum.
But I wanna make sure I'm not assuming that it is image negative sinusitis because histiocytic diseases
can actually have bony destruction of the sinuses. You might remember from step one or step two days you can get proptosis
from the histiocytic diseases, a reminder that they like to take up space in the skull and the legs. So yeah.
Okay, so we're coming to the end, I want to make sure we have time for discussion. It sounds like you want a bone film of some sort.
Is there a blood test for any of this stuff for either GCA or your hairy kidneys?
As a general rule, serology is amazing for small vessel vasculitis and not so good for other forms of vasculitities
where tissue is often the issue with some exception. - Okay, so you think bone film and then ultimately, we're gonna need tissue.
All right. All right, did that. Admitted here you see a whole bunch of tests.
APLS negative, IgG subclass normal, LDH normal, RBR non-reactive, no evidence of lymphoproliferative disease,
TB negative, renal ultrasound, basically saw what they saw before, a little less conspicuous, and they get your leg film
and diffuse soft tissue swelling but really nada. Change your thinking?
I have to go 'cause you commented on the bone. - I would just say start but not the gold standard test.
The gold standard test is a technetium bone scan. I don't know the performance characteristic of an X-ray.
Just know enough to know okay, that's helpful. It would've been helpful if it were a positive, but I wouldn't close the book on it yet. - Okay.
PET scan. Unfortunately, you cannot see, so you're gonna have to believe us that it shows multiple sites
of abnormal hypermetabolism involving most of the large artery walls in the chest, abdomen, pelvis,
lower extremities, renal, adrenal, pericardium, and several foci in the lower extremity bone marrow,
extensive subcutaneous edema and fat stranding with associated hypermetabolism in the left lower extremity.
And we get a biopsy. - I do wanna mention something that teardrop cells on the peripheral smear,
an easy way to remember that something's invading the bone marrow and I'm here looking at Sam, is that when the bone marrow cries, it cries out teardrops
and that's when you can think of something infiltrated. But you know really for me, Rabih,
this seems like a widespread infiltrative disorder
and that's more specific than just saying inflammation and that's when we think about stuff like amyloid, lymphoma,
sarcoidosis, and histiocytes. So I think I'm right there with, like, I'm really curious
of the biopsy but I think it's a good fit for non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
And is that the same as the... - Erdheim-Chester. - Same disease. And these other infiltrative diseases you just mentioned,
why not? - Okay, so for lymphoma, LDH is a poor person's test for it.
If it's really high, it's helpful, but it was normal. The peripheral flow cytometry is good for liquid cancers like leukemia,
less good for B-cell lymphomas but good for T-cell lymphoma. But there isn't much lymphadenopathy and...
None. - Such. So that's out of the, sarcoid, I'll say it's not sarcoid. - Okay. - With confidence.
All right. - I think, like, in fact... - If I say it is, how you gonna feel? - Ah.
I'm not going say that by the way, sorry. Don't worry. - Say that it's not too for me as a resident.
I know that's what he would say. - All right, it's not sarcoid. All right.
Anything you want add, Harry? Oh, look, Maggie, go ahead. - [Maggie] Does the lack of brain involvement give you
any clues at all? - Lack of brain involvement give you any clues? - I think that it would, I wonder if the,
if it's hard to appreciate the presence of brain involvement given the baseline glucose activity on a PET CT scan.
But I think that, yes, histiocytic diseases, not to fixate on that, but histiocytic diseases do have dural
and parenchymal manifestations. But yeah, I think at the end of the day, what's happening here is this disease is being kind enough
to coalesce in a mass and the odds of us not knowing the answer after biopsy are probably just limited
to the test characteristics of biopsy. - Okay, so we are at that stage. Tell us what you think this is.
I would say that I would have a mild to moderate confidence on what the biopsy will show
because all the vasculitities that start with the G have the word granuloma in them
and all of them have an infiltrated phenotype. So I would not be shocked if this patient has a more infiltrative presentation
of either GCA or GPA, but I would say that the prominent perirenal soft tissue
presentation is very evocative of Erdheim-Chester disease. So I would be open to all three of those
and open to honestly any answer because I think it's important to do so. But I would be least surprised
if we see non-Langerhans histiocytes on the path. - Yeah, and he might be younger than me
but I look up to him. - Yeah. - I agree with everything he said. - Okay.
Harry? - [Harry] Can I just ask one another diagnosis? I don't need them. - [Rabih] It's probably the answer, whatever he is gonna say.
[Harry] IgG4 disease. - Oh, shoot. - [Harry] Another cause of large vessel vascular sheath.
Just ask because of the retroperitoneal. - The question was IgG4 disease,
which often comes up in these kinds of discussions... - [Harry] Not all of the IgG4 studies peripherally
are abnormal in that disease. - I think it's a phenomenal thought
and I cannot personally say that it can't be IgG4 'cause that is another very important diagnosis
to consider in the infiltrated group. And the serum tests are not that useful.
And it is critical because IgG4 melts away with steroids and you can treat it. We often see it as, like,
a pancreatic head mass being mistaken for adenocarcinoma and the patient gets a whipple, this happened but all they needed to do was give prednisone.
But on biopsy, you'll see those lymphoplasmacytic infiltration reminiscent
of IgG. with the story form fibrosis. - It might be the best fit if you revisit, which I forgot the history of asthma
and the history of sinusitis, quite honestly. The thing that I slipped is to overemphasize the perirenal manifestation
'cause I know that IgG4 disease tends to involve the ureters and Erdheim-Chester disease tends to follow the renal parenchyma.
But if you revisit this and say what about the asthma history and the wheezing history and the relatively subacute smoldering course,
I think IgG4 is a fantastic fit. - So I'd give you a chance to change your opinion, but I'm gonna go with your Erdheim-Chester.
You're kind to us. - That would be nice for me to do that.
Biopsy results, histiocytic proliferation involving adipose tissue and you see some positives
and negatives of various CDs and some genes and bone marrow biopsy hypercellular marrow
without evidence of of tumor or myelodysplasia.
And the final diagnosis is that. (audience applauding)
So Karena Puldon, who's our chief resident, prepared the case and she's gonna go up and tell us a little bit about this entity.
Thank you. So Erdheim-Chester, it is rare non-Langerhans histiocytosis characterized
by excessive recruitment and activation histiocytes. So I actually have here,
on this slide, you can see the area that I've circled. There are foamy histiocytes
and then down here is the CD 163 positive that's in brown.
And the patient was positive for this. So this is like a positive marker that you'll often see.
And so these are the positive markers which is, and the negative markers that support the diagnosis for the patient.
Occurs more frequently in males than females at a three to one ratio and in ages 40 to 70 years old.
The presentation is very heterogeneous. So it can be asymptomatic or having non-specific symptoms
like chills, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and weakness.
And then patients with a BRAF V600E mutation, which is actually a nearly 50% of patients,
can be treated with this medication here. And then those without this mutation can be treated
with an MEK inhibitor. This patient didn't have the BRAF V600E mutation.
And so sites involved: our bone, the maxillary sinus, the skin, the cardiovascular system, the lungs,
the retroperitoneum, and the CNS. 95%, as Rabih was saying,
do have long bony involvement. And then 20% of them have this vascular involvement
including perivascular infiltration, periaortic fibrosis, and then they can have this coated aorta,
which is what we were seeing on the images. And this finding is really strongly associated
with Erdheim-Chester. And then for the retroperitoneal infiltration,
we have the hairy kidneys as well, which is also really characteristic of this.
And so just to kind of go over the differential diagnosis that was discussed. So really, you know, they zeroed in on the fact
that this was a subacute infiltrative process. And so we have these histiocytic infiltrations,
Erdheim-Chester, and then we also have the Langerhans cell histiocytosis, IgG4 as Harry had mentioned.
And then lymphoma though this patient didn't have any lymphadenopathy. And then other things that we commonly think about amyloid,
sarcoid, hemochromatosis, HLH, and then Rosai-Dorfman, which is also a more rare diagnosis.
So just a clinical summary, the patient was diagnosed with Erdheim-Chester.
It's subacute and infiltrative in nature. And he was followed by hematology, treated with cobimetinib,
a single agent that showed a decrease in the histiocytic process on his repeat PET scan.
[Bob] All right. - Thank you. (audience applauding)
So we have a couple minutes left. I'd love to hear your reflections on the case
and what you learned and what you think we should learn from it. - Karena, that was phenomenal.
I think thinking of just that when to pivot to infiltrative and not forgetting IgG4-related disease is in that bucket.
I have the mnemonic SAL for infiltrative. Sal was a CP Solver. He was a CP Solver C member.
He's still healthy. He is doing okay. Sarcoid, amyloid, lymphoma. But my biggest reflection is
just once you start getting multiple organs, being able to activate
that infiltrative category was the key I think to diagnose this.
Yeah, I think for me this case just tugs on so many different things about sniffing out signal from noise and then to really gain momentum
once you have all the imaging findings that we got. And again, in retrospect, I asked myself like,
"What would push us to have turned this into a CPS case when at the beginning it wasn't?"
And I think it really is attention to detail to what the patient is telling you. And I think in increasingly busy lives
where we're so inclined to move to the next step when things aren't going well or you don't have a grasp on what's going on,
this will sound like a stereotype, but I cannot emphasize how important it is to go back.
And for me it's that slide of the review of systems that is really the most important thing I think we learned today.
And in retrospect, what do you think his shortness of breath was about? - I mean, I think when somebody reports a symptom
of discomfort here that is not manifest when they exert themselves,
it really is, I think, no different than a chest irritation of something.
And so I think he was saying he feels short of breath in large part 'cause his aorta was inflamed,
but it didn't affect his exertional capacity, 'cause thankfully the aorta doesn't play a pivotal role in that until it gets really, really serious.
You think the leg had any, the leg from 50 years ago had anything to do with this or just red herring?
You know, I don't know enough to be confident, but I would say probably a red herring. - Yeah. Cool.
We've got maybe a minute left. Harry, any comments you wanna, I'm never gonna think of this thing other than hairy kidneys.
It's gonna be stuck in my brain. Any comments from anybody?
All right, why don't we quit? Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Karena. That was good. (audience applauding)

Reza Manesh, MD Transcript:
[Reza] I just wanna share on... - Make sure that's on, is it? Yep, and hold it closer.
Yeah, it's an honor to be here every single time, but especially today. And I think that I'm gonna kick off this case
by sharing our gratitude to everyone, especially for the honor for being here on Harry Hollander Day,
which is such a treat. I distinctly remember as a fourth year medical student on a wave rotation sitting across from Harry nervously so,
and getting to know him over the course of the years has been an honor for both of us. And so thank you for having us and I'm very excited to give it a try today.
Yes, I'm gonna leave the medicine for Rabih to discuss.
Perfect. - Just wanted to make two quick comments. One, I am not supposed to be here today.
The only reason I'm here is that Rabih knew how important Harry was to me, is to me,
and decided to share this stage. So thank you for that. And then the second thing is I was having dinner with Asa Clemenzi last night at Zozzy's
and he said, "Don't you get nervous about this?" I said, "No, 'cause Harry taught me that this can be one
of two diagnoses, either infectious or non-infectious." I'm feeling very confident.
Yes, I am intrigued by that. And I think this is gonna be a challenging case 'cause I'm not really sure what's signal and what's noise
'cause there's a myriad of concerns that the patient has. And so the question is where do we focus our attention?
What I've learned is to just be patient. Like, we're not at a, we're not at a pivot point yet. There isn't anything that's strong enough for me
to start investing significant cognitive energy. However, I think the exam is gonna be illuminating.
And I think with the prior sinus surgeries, it makes me wonder what was the pathology
that led to those prior surgeries 'cause that may be linked to what's happening
as the patient presents today. But really the big thing for me is I don't really have a problem representation yet.
There's too much going on for me to settle on one specific concern to tackle.
And that is what you're trying to do. You're trying to basically come up with the one liner that you're trying to solve?
Precisely because if you don't formulate the correct problem representation, you'll 100% end up at the wrong diagnosis.
And so when you get a case like this, you just have to be patient and you have to use more clues to try to figure out
what hill you plan to climb. - Okay. Anything to add, Rabih? - Yeah, I completely agree with Reza.
I think we have to be very, very cautious 'cause getting the problem right is so fundamental
to not going down completely the wrong pathway. If you wouldn't mind going back to one slide, like, I was intrigued.
I pay a lot of attention to how our patients decide
what their chief concern is and what they decide to tell us when we prompt them. And I find it very intriguing that the sinusitis
and the leg rise above the level of shortness of breath.
And I say that because I think you can make a lot of inferences as to why somebody would choose to emphasize their sinus in their leg
over what could be their heart or their lungs. And I think that that might mean that the three foot rule
that we talked about no longer applies. And that now if you look at this very strictly, you're saying there's something in the head,
there's something in the leg. And the only thing that we're missing really is the abdomen And the impetus to actually reframe this not
as too discreet entities of the sinus and the leg, but to say based on the thoracic symptoms,
but most importantly based on the low grade fever, chills, and fatigue, this doesn't seem
to be a compartmentalized disease separating, sparing the viscera.
This seems to be a low-grade systemic disease process.
And I think that it's so easy to disregard the underlying tempo
of the background information because in reality most of this stuff,
because the patient chose to say it on review of systems, in real life, probably turns out to be more noise than it does signal.
But what do I really wanna do on exam? I wanna make sure that I don't get trapped into the vortex
of just paying attention to correlates of what the patient led with. Say, "Hey, is there actually a signature in the chest
and is there a signature systemically?" So the one vital sign that I probably won't get unless I ask for it is a weight
is something I'm really, really intrigued by. Because if this stuff is signal, it probably will be accompanied by weight loss.
And if it's not accompanied by weight loss, this probably is distracter. - So that's an interesting cognitive leap you just made.
So sinus and leg, I guess maybe there's some three foot rule,
too far apart to be connected. - I made it up. - And add in shortness of breath.
And no longer are you thinking about discrete things, but now you're packaging in them. Is that because shortness
of breath has a certain kind of salience? It sort of rises in level of importance and if you had just given that as the chief complaint,
it would've dominated it or it's now three things and that seems too weird for them to be three independent things?
Yeah, I think that the underlying assumption here is that there are no benign causes of shortness of breath
or spontaneously resolving ones. There are many spontaneously resolving conditions that involve the sinuses and the legs.
And so I think that a specific explanation for the shortness of breath is needed. And by the way, I retract that.
I did not come up with the three foot rule. - Yeah. - Colleague and mentor Mike Nejad did. And I give him full credit for that or not if it doesn't...
Yeah, it may not work. In which case you now know who to blame. - Okay, good. But helpful to see how you're thinking
about it really is you add that in and now it feels like there's something involving multiple parts of the body.
It's hard to now just say it's two discrete things. - And something low grade and sneaky. And I think the tricky part about this stuff
is it's not in your face shortness of breath and hectic fevers. It's something that's been trickling on for a little while.
Great. Okay, let's hear a little more.
Some meds. Vastatin, timolol, Tylenol, and ibuprofen.
Some ophthalmic stuff and a bunch of supplements. Make anything out of any of that?
The unmute button. Nada. All right. - We'll move on.
Past history: born in Germany, raised in Iowa, pretty common pathway.
Professor and veteran also, we got a lot of interesting combinations here. Lives alone in San Francisco,
goes to Europe a bunch of times a year. Family history: father and mother died of probably their cardiovascular disease
at reasonable ages. Health-related behavior. A former smoker, but quit a long time ago.
Alcohol, six drinks per week, and denies other substance use.
Physical exam. Afebrile, little bit desaturated, 94% on two liters.
Little systolic hypertension, otherwise fine. We don't get a weight.
And Karena's put the case together, is nice enough to put the red stuff in to help you.
Constitutional, okay. Minimal tenderness to palpation over the sinuses with some clear drainage.
Cardiac exam, normal. Pulmonary exam shows some wheezing.
Abdomen appears to be benign. Extremities, the left lower extremity edema
with well-demarcated borders, pitting edema to the thigh, tender to palpation, and pulses are okay.
Sensation seems okay. Right leg trace pitting edema to the calf. Neuro seems fine.
And skin, no rashes or lesions. Comments? - Yeah, totally.
I think the oxygen saturation surprised me and that's something that the final diagnosis must explain.
Interestingly enough, a lot of patients who are labeled as having COPD or asthma never actually have a pulmonary function test.
And I think in a case like this where we're worried about multiple organs being involved,
it's really important to look at the prior data to see if this diagnosis of COPD was in fact confirmed or not.
Because if it's a new diagnosis later in life, maybe we question that and we think of a mimicker like EGPA.
I think with regard to the sinus tenderness... - Oh, the mimicker was what? - EGPA. - What is that?
Oh, EGPA is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. - Of course. - Oh, sorry.
I was testing you. - Oh, okay. - What did that used to be called?
I put away what it used to be called. - Okay. All right. I think Wegner's, if I'm not...
It was the old Wegner's. - Or Churg-Strauss. - Churg-Strauss Thanks. - Thank you. (Bob laughing)
And then you have the sinus tenderness. And I think that's intriguing.
He's had issues with his sinuses in the past and it would be really interesting to see if you can link sinus, lung,
and what's happening in the lower extremities. I think the main key here, Bob, is that not all wheezing is due to COPD or asthma.
There are other causes and, like, confirming those diagnoses by looking at prior data is gonna be important.
And something with the lower extremities that was really interesting is that oftentimes when someone presents
with a unilateral problem, we assume it's only unilateral. But remember sometimes a bilateral process starts unilateral
or an asymmetrical process dominates your eye and your mind where you don't pay attention
to the other extremity. So here, the leg being edematous makes me think anatomically
is there something happening at the level of the skin and soft tissue, is something happening at the level of the muscle,
the fascia, the bone? And then in that review system that you presented, there was calf numbness.
Now that's a peculiar finding that I would investigate further. And I don't know if that's because of the edema compressing the superficial nerves.
And then finally going to that right lower extremity. It just makes me wonder whether this is initially unilateral
where we automatically jump to stuff like DVT, cellulitis, Charcot,
but rather given time, does it become bilateral? And really what we should be exploring
is cause of bilateral lower extremity edema. - So let me show you a picture.
Any comments on that? - Yeah. Yeah, oh, so I'm impressed
and surprised by the degree of erythema. I think it really stands out in the visual. I see that the foot really has,
oh, you mentioned that the patient has chronic venous stasis. You see given the medial predominance, especially on the right and left.
So what is it that you're cuing on to tell you that you think it is venous stasis? - The medial predominance on the right
and the left of the erythema. - Of hyperpigmentation or erythema? - Yeah, of erythema, hyperpigmentation,
and of course, the sock sign, which I think I see only on the right side suggesting that this has been going on for some time.
So a sock sign, meaning where at the margin of his sock you're more likely to get hyperpigmentation?
Exactly. And I think more so on the right than the left, you appreciate the superficial dilated varicose veins
which are more prominent on the foot, a little bit unusual in their location, I usually expect them to be more on the lower aspect of the tibia.
But I think, you know, it's hard often for non-dermatologists to vocalize the,
like, I look at this leg and I can tell you more confidence internally than I can vocalize that there's chronicity to this problem.
But the left is, gosh, I mean I think I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out
if I can be confident distinguishing a DVT from cellulitis and I think I would have a really tough time. 'Cause in general, the more swollen a leg is,
the more likely it is to be venous hypertension, acute or chronic. The more erythematous and painful it is,
the more likely it is to be infected. And I think this patient seems to have prominent features of both. So in real life, would probably evaluate for both.
I think it would be really, really telling to see what happens to that left leg with 30 minutes
or an hour of elevation 'cause I think if I were seeing this case in real life, Bob, I would not have guessed
that they end up as a CPS case. And the reason I say that is patient has a history of asthma, patient has a history of venous stasis,
here they are with sinus issues, thoracic concerns, and potentially complications of venous stasis.
So I'm really, really... - Really, we could screw up pretty badly by making that a CPS case.
You know, I think I would be stumped if this turns out to be cellulitis in a little bit of a bad aspect because my mind is not going there
at all knowing the bias of this. But I think it just goes to show how authentically the conclusions that will come
to at the end of the hour will be very interesting. And I'm excited to see what the twist will be.
I don't see a twist yet, but in retrospect, I'll wanna know what the weight is 'cause, again, I think that that review of systems is key.
Is that signal or is it noise? And it would be really, really telling to see, despite the edema, despite the venous stasis,
has the weight gone down? And I'd be really, I know I probably don't have that data now and I probably wouldn't get it
in real life honestly because you are dealing with acuity. But I think... - Is it bothering you that if your main differential cellulitis versus DVT,
is it bothering you to not have a fever with that much cellulitis? - It's a really, really good question. You definitely see fever with cellulitis,
but I would say that's the exception rather than the rule. I say that with a little bit of humility because I don't know how good I am at diagnosing cellulitis.
It's a very tricky diagnosis to make. And if you look at the dermatology literature, we get it wrong plenty of times.
And I would say the number of times I've diagnosed a febrile surface infection
of the foot is not many. - Okay. Anything to add? - Nada.
And one of the things you were cuing on on the exam was hypoxemia.
Does that create an illness script here? Oh, he's got a DVT and he is got a PE, boom, I'm done.
No, not at all. It just makes me intrigued to look at the lungs and just knowing that our physical exam is limited,
a positive finding is positive and it should alter the process. Like, if I heard crackles, like, is there water or pus in that lungs?
But a negative finding does not exclude the possibility of parenchymal pathology.
So I'm very curious am I gonna label this as image negative hypoxemia or is a chest x-ray gonna show something
that explains the hypoxia. - Okay, so you've already kind of gone through this.
Let's go. Yeah, go ahead, Harry. - [Harry] Does it sound good?
I'm just wondering if you're thinking about cellulitis mimickers at this point.
You've mentioned a couple of common ones. Should we be thinking about less common things
in the context of somebody who, as you have already pointed out, sounds as though he may have
a systemic inflammatory illness?
Would it be crossing my mind in real life? I don't think so, honestly.
And that probably is reality just dumbed down, damped down by sheer base rate
of unusual presentations presenting this way. It would be very different if you were febrile. I think it would be pretty different
if he didn't have the context of the venous stasis and the COPD to have inlets to unusual presentations of those diseases.
So if I'm being authentic about what I'd be doing in real life, I don't think I would be right now.
I clearly should be based on where we're going. - Well, based on the fact that you're at...
Yeah. - Under rounds, right? - And honestly, I'm really excited to see, in retrospect,
if there was a clue, and I'm excited to learn from you, in retrospect, if there was a clue that we could latch onto now.
You know, I think you can say, "Oh, this is a", I'm not gonna say that word again 'cause I'm thinking in the back of my mind.
But there is sinusitis, there's asthma that triggers a whole chain of things
that I think because we're being slow and reflective here, we're prone to thinking about.
I'll say it again. The only thing that would change my mind in the moment is if I saw weight loss. I think that would really make me worried.
Okay, pretty skinny right leg. - Yeah. Agreed, agreed, agreed.
And then the observation on the toes too. Yeah, there are things there, but I don't know if I would with the sort
of data we have now. - Okay, let's go on. We have a little anemia, a little low iron,
a little A1C, and a little TSH. Electrolytes seem fine.
Maybe a tiny elevation in creatinine from baseline, glucose 153, LFT's fine, albumin 3.1.
Any of that interesting or surprising? - Not surprising but interesting, yes. In that the low albumin, the anemia,
the high ferritin points to this underlying inflammatory process,
the transference that being low tells you there's a mixed iron deficiency and anemia, chronic inflammation,
and the creatinine, we have to be very cautious here 'cause we're saying this patient is cachectic, has lost muscle mass.
Creatinine comes from the muscle. A better test of renal function is cystatin C in this context who Shlipak really popularized.
And I would say I would really be interested in a urinalysis 'cause I wanna know as we're exploring the possibility
of a multi-systemic disease, whether the kidneys are affected as well.
Both in part due to the creatine elevation and likely weight loss. But I'm just very curious to see if there's any proteinuria
that may explain some kind of underlying small vessel pathology.
Okay. Patient went to the clinical decision unit
for observation. While awaiting studies to return, he developed AFib with RVR, given fluids, metoprolol.
Chest x-ray, cardiac silhouette, partly obscured, right hemidiaphragm elevated, mild bibasilar atelectasis,
no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. DVT ultrasound is negative for a DVT
up to the common femoral vein and they see subcutaneous edema in the left lower extremity.
All right, any comments on any of this right now? - Yeah, I'd emphasize that that negative DVT ultrasound,
the performance characteristics of that are phenomenal. So I think that in the world of common things being common, you would probably say, "Okay,
you know, I'm gonna treat this patient empirically for cellulitis and watch what happens to that leg." I'd say the AFib here is very, very telling,
'cause again, you can park that right next to the COPD, but the development of it in this context,
especially noting how prominent the edema was on that left lower leg makes you,
that's why I would be a little bit systematic and say, "Okay, what causes the trigger of atrial fibrillation with RVR?"
And I think a three-pronged simple way of thinking about that is the patient has an increased sympathetic tone for whatever reason.
And here with the possibility of an infection, that's a very plausible explanation. The others is adjacent diseases.
You all become accustomed to anything in the cardiothoracic area being an explanation for triggering AFib being as common as COPD
as postoperative CT surgery. But that hypothesis, that sort of adjacent structural disease is
what I'm really thinking about because we've not lost track of the fact that this patient had longstanding
and a key word here, longstanding non-exertional shortness of breath.
I hear that and I think that this case, the development of atrial fibrillation and the pickup of hypoxemia pushes
that front and center in my mind. I say, "What could cause somebody to feel short of breath
that would not be affected by their exertion?" Is it the heart, unusual. Is it the lungs, unusual.
Is it the blood, unusual. Or is it the common denominator, i.e., the mediastinum?
You know, to skip over a deep dive reflection. But if you are dealing with a systemic disease that lands in the chest, it's probably landing in the chest
because of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or mediastinal vascular issues
like the pulmonary RV or the aorta. So even with a completely normal D-dimer in this instance,
as you showed us on the next slide, I'd be really interested in actually looking at the mediastinum in this person in large part
because there seems to be no pulmonary parenchymal or overt cardiac, i.e., heart failure, other arrhythmia.
So long story short, I'm really glad that they got the CTPE both for the PE aspect.
But also to really visualize the mediastinum. - So you would not just say AFib 'cause sick person and maybe inflammatory state,
but you're wondering is something tweaking the heart that's causing it and there are a whole bunch of structures nearby
and it sort of goes with the shortness of breath, something's going on but we haven't found out what it is just yet. - Put it better than I just did.
All right, good. CTPE. Oh, that's not projecting at all.
I will tell you that is the aorta that is being outlined there. And we have a reading on it.
Sorry it didn't project. Exam degraded by respiratory motion artifact such that segmental and smaller emboli could be missed
but no large PE seen. Soft tissue attenuation around the thoracic aorta
and proximal arch vessels, which could represent intramural hematoma or vasculitis.
So you are wondering is there's something going on in the vessels or the mediastinum appears to be true, right?
So what do you think? - Yes, I'm reminded of Dr. Ken Sacks and a pearl he shared when I was a resident here.
He said it's easy to diagnose a vasculopathy but difficult to diagnose a vasculitis.
And here we're faced with that on the CAT scan where it seems like we have vessel pathology
and the question becomes is that due to atherosclerosis and then a subsequent hematoma in someone who has a history
of cardiovascular disease or is the vessel actually inflamed because of an underlying either infectious
or non-infectious vasculitis? And I think back to Mike Nejad or Rabih's three foot rule,
all of a sudden, we're now making the connection between the sinus, the legs, and potentially the mediastinum.
I would view this as signal as opposed to noise. And I would be curious whether this is representative
of either a large vessel vasculitis that's autoimmune in nature or infectious in nature.
And the radiologists are really good to see how that gadolinium or iodinated contrast enhances the aortic wall.
And based on its enhancement, if it's full thickness, et cetera, they can prioritize amongst inflammatory processes.
So it could be that this is a hematoma from athero spread. I think it would be a mistake to dismiss this finding.
I think it just invokes the possibility of both. - Even though the finding is almost an incidental finding. I guess. Rabih, you sort of convinced me,
maybe it's not incidental 'cause you were interested in the vessels as opposed to I would've just been getting a PE study,
a negative PE and next case. So to you it was not an incidental finding. It was something you were very interested in
as you were trying to piece the whole thing together. - As I said, we hang out once a week and do this together.
And I think in many of our conversations, we've talked about how, of course, what we say out loud is probably not true.
That the answer is literally in the history. But I think what we have passed on
through generations is that a powerful clue to the answer in the history is, and yes, I think
if the patient did not have low-grade fevers and he did not have non-exertional shortness of breath,
this would probably be an incidental finding. But if you go back and you gain confidence that the patient is having periodic fevers at home,
chills, and actually has non-exertional shortness of breath, I think this is a very good explanation for that finding.
Now the question I think is you probably would believe that this is signal, the question is, it is quite a leap of faith to go to call this a vasculitis
because the radiographic imprint of fat stranding may be a distracter.
It also is a little bit of leap of faith 'cause when we say vasculitis, we, unfortunately, assume it's autoimmune in nature
when there are some infections and malignancies to also consider affecting the aorta. So I think resisting the,
oh, this is GCA right away is important and there's two steps to that. How confident are we that it's inflammatory?
And I'd say we'd be a little bit more confident on the patient's symptoms. And then to take a brief pause
and say, "Okay, I've said inflammatory. I know inflammatory plus vascular
often means vasculitis, but it's often enough the patient has a cat
and they have Bartonella or the patient has an infiltrative malignancy and their anemia becomes more significant."
Those would be my two cautions. - I'm gonna move on in a sec, but you're not only trying to piece together this finding,
but you're still interested in the sinuses and still interested in the leg. Does that sway you that you have to figure out something
that could be doing the aorta but also involving those other organs that tilt you toward an itis
versus an infection versus something else? - No, honestly it doesn't necessarily.
But if I'm in that vasculitis bucket that's autoimmune, all of a sudden, I start thinking about a variable vessel vasculitis,
something that can involve all vessels as opposed to just specific large vessel,
medium vessel, or small vessel 'cause we said it was a sinus, we have stuff going on in the lower extremities and then we have this big aorta that's involved.
Okay. All right, I'm gonna move along a little bit. Vascular surgeries consulted. Given the concern for hematoma,
they recommend an eight hour clearance of the contrast and to repeat the study. And I think you've kind of gone through this.
Let's get some additional data. Vascular surgery recommended lowering the blood pressure
in case this was, I guess, in case it's bleeding. Given the erythema, started on empiric antibiotics
for possible cellulitis. Repeat CT was done with contrast. Let's see if this shows up.
Not particularly well. The reading is mural thickening of the thoracic aorta
and proximal arch vessels unchanged an extent and thickness from the recent CT
and demonstrates attenuation coefficient in the high 50s. In the appropriate clinical setting such
as acute chest pain, this raises suspicion for a type A intramural hematoma,
particularly given another finding when enlarging left pleural effusion.
All right. Where are you now based on that study? - Bob, can we go just two slides before if that's okay?
And I'll leave this for Rabih. Well, one more slide before, yeah, leave that up. - Rabih's an expert on the coefficient numbers.
Looking forward to hearing him go through that. - I just wanted to comment on the text that was on this slide
or the previous slide, Bob. Now I made you do all that, I feel like I have to say something really epic.
Yeah, it's gonna be good. (everyone laughing) - I do have something epic to share. The labetalol.
It's really important to realize, and I made this mistake as a third year resident at the county hospital
where someone was having an acute aortic syndrome and I thought I just had to lower the blood pressure and I gave hydralazine.
What I learned from Lawrence Tyranny is that, no, you want to decrease the sheer stress into the aorta.
If you just give hydralazine, if you think about the physics formula of DP over DT, don't think about it. Don't Wikipedia it.
You need to decrease both the heart rate and what's happening. And so labetalol is the right choice
when you're worried about acute aortic syndromes 'cause it does decrease the sheer stress that's occurring.
Okay, great. You wanna comment on the 50 coefficient or we'll leave that one for another.
This one of my favorite things I get to say. I have absolutely no clue what that means. - Oh, okay, good. - [Rabih] I look forward to that moment.
Yeah, I lean heavily, this is a team sport and I would be in getting informed
by our friendly radiologist and other experts too. - Sounds good. All right, we have a bunch of additional data coming.
Given the normal DVT ultrasound, vascular recommended venous phase imaging to evaluate for I guess a higher up thrombosis.
On repeat review of systems, the patient denied chest or back pain. Also denied a history of hypertension.
You have some labs here with sed rate and CRP in red.
Urine protein a little elevated, otherwise, UA is normal. You see the protein creatinine ratio.
CK is normal. ANA low. Complements fine. Smear you see there with anisocytosis.
And troponin 0.02. Comments? - Yeah, I think that we're getting more and more weight of...
Hold it a little closer. Yeah. - Yeah, I think we're getting more and more weight that this is, in fact, an inflammatory syndrome.
And I say that not because of the ESR 'cause aids adjusted, that's probably not too too high with the CRP and I think you could park
that CRP onto the leg and say, "Hey, this is a DVT ultrasound negative left lower extremity cellulitis."
But I think that the aortic findings cannot be ignored. And I think that given the,
I mean, I just go on radiology buzzwords. I think experts interpret these images and I'm not one of them,
but thickening to me is a concept that implies chronicity.
And I think that the syndrome of what,
you know, going back again, the patient said this has been going on for, there's something brewing beyond the sinus and the leg and the CRP I think adds a little bit of weight of evidence.
I think it's plausible to park it next to the leg, but I think it's too morbid to dismiss the idea
that the inflammation actually is originating in the chest and the aorta. So I would ask myself,
I don't know that this is aortitis, but I know that that word sounds really scary
and I should probably start to either think about it myself or get very, very close to getting some experts involved.
Okay. You're agreeing? All right. - Always. - Thank you. - Always.
And by the way, I should point out the t-shirts. So these are Hollander... - Yes. - T-shirts that they're both wearing,
bespoke Hollander t-shirts. You cannot get this at Target. Okay, they get a CT abdomen
and pelvis I guess looking for other areas that might be involved or infiltrated.
And what they see is diffuse periarterial soft tissue thickening or less likely mural thickening
involving several arteries in the belly and pelvis, no lymphadenopathy.
A thin, irregular rind of enhancing soft tissue surrounds both kidneys with infiltration into the renal sinus
along the proximal periureteral space causing mild left pelviectasis,
which I looked up and actually is a thing, without frank hydronephrosis. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are seen.
Interesting 'cause the LFTs were normal. - Yes, and this also highlights
that the exam is just not perfect at detecting these abnormalities. A simple way to hepatomegaly is just to think is the liver inflamed?
Is it congested or is it infiltrated? I think once you have enlarged liver, enlarged spleen,
and stuff going on in the aorta and the sinus, that infiltrative category in my mind gets prioritized.
And now I think we really gotta view the aortic pathology
as beyond just atherosclerosis, as beyond atherosclerosis. And really I would lean into vasculitis at this point.
And in my mind, in addition to infections like staph, streps, syphilis, salmonella,
and atypical stuff, I would be thinking about that autoimmune category. And I know with the kidneys
and the finding around it, there is a pathognomonic finding
for a rare diagnosis Erdheim-Chester disease, which is hairy kidney. So I might talk... - Hairy kidney?
Not Harry Hollander but hairy. - Harry, we named these rounds for him but I don't think the kidneys been...
No, no, the kidneys are not part of it. Yeah, so like that category beyond, like, large vessel,
which is giant cell, takayasus, the variable vessel is relapsing polyangiitis, but we don't really have any cartilage stuff going on.
Then there's Behcet's but there's no ulcers. There's Cogan's, which I don't know much about
so I'll defer to Rabih, but I know that sinus and more upper here. And then you have Erdheim-Chester disease.
Dr. Da Lio and I, we published my first case, not his first case, by that time, it was 100 for him.
Of a coat with the clue and the coat was the aorta and it just entirely was enhanced,
which was due to infiltrative, it's a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
But I'm just curious to Rabih, like, what do you think? Are you in that infiltrative category or... - Yeah, I'm right there next to you.
And I think that it's just, isn't it humbling what can be hidden in the abdomen and pelvis?
I mean, we examined this person, listened to their chest, felt their belly, and there was nothing there. It goes back to listening very intently
to what your patient was saying. And I think I'm right there with you. I'm running my differential diagnosis for a vasculitis.
And as a brief primer, we tend to divide vasculitities as proffered, I said, into large vessel, medium vessel,
small vessel and then recognize a category of diseases where the patient can have vasculitis across multiple spectrum.
And that's called a variable vessel vasculitis. If you want to associate buzzwords with each of these conditions, you'll see a small vessel vasculitis
affects the skin in the form of purpura and the kidney in the form of glomerulonephritis. Both of those are absent here.
Medium vessel vasculitis are very, very cryptic and they essentially affect, most of the time, the intraabdominal organs
with a polyarteritis nodosa being the lead example, though that can have skin manifestation.
And then in kids, really, Kawasaki's disease in the heart. Large vessel vasculitities are the ones
that will be entertaining here, involvement of the aorta. And I would just emphasize that as you start
to think about the large vessel vasculitities, you'll be triggered to think reflexively of, based on age, giant cell arteritis and an older adult
and Takayasu's arteritis in the younger person. Those are gonna be the the things
that you think about the most. However, variable vessel vasculitities
by definition affect all vessels and you're gonna be running that list as well. And then you're gonna be a little bit cautious
and remember that large vessels, including the aorta, have small vessels that feed them, the vasa vasorum.
So there are rare presentations of small vessel vasculitities affecting the aorta.
And so we had a case on our platform of somebody who had glomerulonephritis and aortitis and they had...
I would say what's the most powerful filter to apply that. I would say this isn't... - Move the mic a little closer.
Oh, this isn't just a vasculitis, this seems to be a vasculitis
with a prominent extravascular imprint. And so in some sense, if you close your eyes
and visualize what's happening, there is a disease infiltrating the liver and the spleen
and infiltrating the blood vessels. And radiologists can actually study that
and tell you based on the pattern of inflammation, if it's circumferential around the outside of the aorta
or partially around the outside of the aorta. So this is why I'm right there with Prof Rez and I would be, of course,
prioritizing based on base rate GCA in this patient. But the infiltrative pattern is very, very open.
What is GCA? - Giant cell arteries. - And you'd be prioritizing just because it's a more common disease
in some of the less common disease that that Reza mentioned. - You say older adult with aortitis,
you have to lead with GCA. It's so common. Unusual, less common version
of that's probably still more common than anything else. But the weight of the infiltrative pattern is so strong here
that you would probably say okay now let me go to that variable vessel category and pursue that.
Not in lieu of but alongside. And that's when I go back to the leg
because I agree with Prof Rez. The radiographic imprint here is very telling at Erdheim-Chester disease
and Erdheim-Chester disease will, universally, have bilateral bony involvement in both.
So now I'm wondering, "Hey, was I wrong about the inflammation being in the skin? Was it actually in the bones?"
And importantly, going back to the sinus, sinusitis in a vasculitis world triggers the notion
of the ANCA-associated vasculitities, which we talked about how they could loop back in and cause aortitis to the vasa vasorum.
But I wanna make sure I'm not assuming that it is image negative sinusitis because histiocytic diseases
can actually have bony destruction of the sinuses. You might remember from step one or step two days you can get proptosis
from the histiocytic diseases, a reminder that they like to take up space in the skull and the legs. So yeah.
Okay, so we're coming to the end, I want to make sure we have time for discussion. It sounds like you want a bone film of some sort.
Is there a blood test for any of this stuff for either GCA or your hairy kidneys?
As a general rule, serology is amazing for small vessel vasculitis and not so good for other forms of vasculitities
where tissue is often the issue with some exception. - Okay, so you think bone film and then ultimately, we're gonna need tissue.
All right. All right, did that. Admitted here you see a whole bunch of tests.
APLS negative, IgG subclass normal, LDH normal, RBR non-reactive, no evidence of lymphoproliferative disease,
TB negative, renal ultrasound, basically saw what they saw before, a little less conspicuous, and they get your leg film
and diffuse soft tissue swelling but really nada. Change your thinking?
I have to go 'cause you commented on the bone. - I would just say start but not the gold standard test.
The gold standard test is a technetium bone scan. I don't know the performance characteristic of an X-ray.
Just know enough to know okay, that's helpful. It would've been helpful if it were a positive, but I wouldn't close the book on it yet. - Okay.
PET scan. Unfortunately, you cannot see, so you're gonna have to believe us that it shows multiple sites
of abnormal hypermetabolism involving most of the large artery walls in the chest, abdomen, pelvis,
lower extremities, renal, adrenal, pericardium, and several foci in the lower extremity bone marrow,
extensive subcutaneous edema and fat stranding with associated hypermetabolism in the left lower extremity.
And we get a biopsy. - I do wanna mention something that teardrop cells on the peripheral smear,
an easy way to remember that something's invading the bone marrow and I'm here looking at Sam, is that when the bone marrow cries, it cries out teardrops
and that's when you can think of something infiltrated. But you know really for me, Rabih,
this seems like a widespread infiltrative disorder
and that's more specific than just saying inflammation and that's when we think about stuff like amyloid, lymphoma,
sarcoidosis, and histiocytes. So I think I'm right there with, like, I'm really curious
of the biopsy but I think it's a good fit for non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
And is that the same as the... - Erdheim-Chester. - Same disease. And these other infiltrative diseases you just mentioned,
why not? - Okay, so for lymphoma, LDH is a poor person's test for it.
If it's really high, it's helpful, but it was normal. The peripheral flow cytometry is good for liquid cancers like leukemia,
less good for B-cell lymphomas but good for T-cell lymphoma. But there isn't much lymphadenopathy and...
None. - Such. So that's out of the, sarcoid, I'll say it's not sarcoid. - Okay. - With confidence.
All right. - I think, like, in fact... - If I say it is, how you gonna feel? - Ah.
I'm not going say that by the way, sorry. Don't worry. - Say that it's not too for me as a resident.
I know that's what he would say. - All right, it's not sarcoid. All right.
Anything you want add, Harry? Oh, look, Maggie, go ahead. - [Maggie] Does the lack of brain involvement give you
any clues at all? - Lack of brain involvement give you any clues? - I think that it would, I wonder if the,
if it's hard to appreciate the presence of brain involvement given the baseline glucose activity on a PET CT scan.
But I think that, yes, histiocytic diseases, not to fixate on that, but histiocytic diseases do have dural
and parenchymal manifestations. But yeah, I think at the end of the day, what's happening here is this disease is being kind enough
to coalesce in a mass and the odds of us not knowing the answer after biopsy are probably just limited
to the test characteristics of biopsy. - Okay, so we are at that stage. Tell us what you think this is.
I would say that I would have a mild to moderate confidence on what the biopsy will show
because all the vasculitities that start with the G have the word granuloma in them
and all of them have an infiltrated phenotype. So I would not be shocked if this patient has a more infiltrative presentation
of either GCA or GPA, but I would say that the prominent perirenal soft tissue
presentation is very evocative of Erdheim-Chester disease. So I would be open to all three of those
and open to honestly any answer because I think it's important to do so. But I would be least surprised
if we see non-Langerhans histiocytes on the path. - Yeah, and he might be younger than me
but I look up to him. - Yeah. - I agree with everything he said. - Okay.
Harry? - [Harry] Can I just ask one another diagnosis? I don't need them. - [Rabih] It's probably the answer, whatever he is gonna say.
[Harry] IgG4 disease. - Oh, shoot. - [Harry] Another cause of large vessel vascular sheath.
Just ask because of the retroperitoneal. - The question was IgG4 disease,
which often comes up in these kinds of discussions... - [Harry] Not all of the IgG4 studies peripherally
are abnormal in that disease. - I think it's a phenomenal thought
and I cannot personally say that it can't be IgG4 'cause that is another very important diagnosis
to consider in the infiltrated group. And the serum tests are not that useful.
And it is critical because IgG4 melts away with steroids and you can treat it. We often see it as, like,
a pancreatic head mass being mistaken for adenocarcinoma and the patient gets a whipple, this happened but all they needed to do was give prednisone.
But on biopsy, you'll see those lymphoplasmacytic infiltration reminiscent
of IgG. with the story form fibrosis. - It might be the best fit if you revisit, which I forgot the history of asthma
and the history of sinusitis, quite honestly. The thing that I slipped is to overemphasize the perirenal manifestation
'cause I know that IgG4 disease tends to involve the ureters and Erdheim-Chester disease tends to follow the renal parenchyma.
But if you revisit this and say what about the asthma history and the wheezing history and the relatively subacute smoldering course,
I think IgG4 is a fantastic fit. - So I'd give you a chance to change your opinion, but I'm gonna go with your Erdheim-Chester.
You're kind to us. - That would be nice for me to do that.
Biopsy results, histiocytic proliferation involving adipose tissue and you see some positives
and negatives of various CDs and some genes and bone marrow biopsy hypercellular marrow
without evidence of of tumor or myelodysplasia.
And the final diagnosis is that. (audience applauding)
So Karena Puldon, who's our chief resident, prepared the case and she's gonna go up and tell us a little bit about this entity.
Thank you. So Erdheim-Chester, it is rare non-Langerhans histiocytosis characterized
by excessive recruitment and activation histiocytes. So I actually have here,
on this slide, you can see the area that I've circled. There are foamy histiocytes
and then down here is the CD 163 positive that's in brown.
And the patient was positive for this. So this is like a positive marker that you'll often see.
And so these are the positive markers which is, and the negative markers that support the diagnosis for the patient.
Occurs more frequently in males than females at a three to one ratio and in ages 40 to 70 years old.
The presentation is very heterogeneous. So it can be asymptomatic or having non-specific symptoms
like chills, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and weakness.
And then patients with a BRAF V600E mutation, which is actually a nearly 50% of patients,
can be treated with this medication here. And then those without this mutation can be treated
with an MEK inhibitor. This patient didn't have the BRAF V600E mutation.
And so sites involved: our bone, the maxillary sinus, the skin, the cardiovascular system, the lungs,
the retroperitoneum, and the CNS. 95%, as Rabih was saying,
do have long bony involvement. And then 20% of them have this vascular involvement
including perivascular infiltration, periaortic fibrosis, and then they can have this coated aorta,
which is what we were seeing on the images. And this finding is really strongly associated
with Erdheim-Chester. And then for the retroperitoneal infiltration,
we have the hairy kidneys as well, which is also really characteristic of this.
And so just to kind of go over the differential diagnosis that was discussed. So really, you know, they zeroed in on the fact
that this was a subacute infiltrative process. And so we have these histiocytic infiltrations,
Erdheim-Chester, and then we also have the Langerhans cell histiocytosis, IgG4 as Harry had mentioned.
And then lymphoma though this patient didn't have any lymphadenopathy. And then other things that we commonly think about amyloid,
sarcoid, hemochromatosis, HLH, and then Rosai-Dorfman, which is also a more rare diagnosis.
So just a clinical summary, the patient was diagnosed with Erdheim-Chester.
It's subacute and infiltrative in nature. And he was followed by hematology, treated with cobimetinib,
a single agent that showed a decrease in the histiocytic process on his repeat PET scan.
[Bob] All right. - Thank you. (audience applauding)
So we have a couple minutes left. I'd love to hear your reflections on the case
and what you learned and what you think we should learn from it. - Karena, that was phenomenal.
I think thinking of just that when to pivot to infiltrative and not forgetting IgG4-related disease is in that bucket.
I have the mnemonic SAL for infiltrative. Sal was a CP Solver. He was a CP Solver C member.
He's still healthy. He is doing okay. Sarcoid, amyloid, lymphoma. But my biggest reflection is
just once you start getting multiple organs, being able to activate
that infiltrative category was the key I think to diagnose this.
Yeah, I think for me this case just tugs on so many different things about sniffing out signal from noise and then to really gain momentum
once you have all the imaging findings that we got. And again, in retrospect, I asked myself like,
"What would push us to have turned this into a CPS case when at the beginning it wasn't?"
And I think it really is attention to detail to what the patient is telling you. And I think in increasingly busy lives
where we're so inclined to move to the next step when things aren't going well or you don't have a grasp on what's going on,
this will sound like a stereotype, but I cannot emphasize how important it is to go back.
And for me it's that slide of the review of systems that is really the most important thing I think we learned today.
And in retrospect, what do you think his shortness of breath was about? - I mean, I think when somebody reports a symptom
of discomfort here that is not manifest when they exert themselves,
it really is, I think, no different than a chest irritation of something.
And so I think he was saying he feels short of breath in large part 'cause his aorta was inflamed,
but it didn't affect his exertional capacity, 'cause thankfully the aorta doesn't play a pivotal role in that until it gets really, really serious.
You think the leg had any, the leg from 50 years ago had anything to do with this or just red herring?
You know, I don't know enough to be confident, but I would say probably a red herring. - Yeah. Cool.
We've got maybe a minute left. Harry, any comments you wanna, I'm never gonna think of this thing other than hairy kidneys.
It's gonna be stuck in my brain. Any comments from anybody?
All right, why don't we quit? Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Karena. That was good. (audience applauding)
